The era of commercial space has arrived, and there are several companies that are making 
space travel affordable for everyone. Perhaps the most successful of them is SpaceX, and one of 
the reasons is that their rocket launch is relatively inexpensive.

• SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

• Therefore, this aims to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. By determining the first stage landing and its resusability, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

• Aim:
- Determine the reason for successful Space X launch at such a low cost.
- Determine if Space X will reuse the first stage of the launch.
